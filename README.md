surf-exel is a silly editor.


It takes in an os path to a file, for example:

and asks you to give one mode, r for reading and w for writing.

## When you give the mode w

It asks you to commit in a while loop.
to stop it asking, take a new line and write a full stop
.
## When you give the mode r

It prints the contents of a file and breaks.

navigate to the directory where your surf-exel is kept using cd, for example:
~~~ $ cd Downloads ~~~
~~~ $ cd surf-exel ~~~
