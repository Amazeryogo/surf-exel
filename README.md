# What is Surf-exel?

Surf-exel is a simple editor built on top of Tkinter and written entirely in Python3 (along with some shell files)

It is lightweight and easily customizable to suit your needs 

The non-GUI version was inspired by ed , a simple GNU text editor.

from V5.3 onwards , we have added GTTS (Google Text To Speech) to allow you to know the version of your surf-exel  and the contents of your text just by hearing it.

# How fast do it get updated ?

A new version of surf-exel is released in the time space of 18 hours to 18 days.

But you still have to download the latest version manually (on all platforms)
 we are going to fix it in v5.5

# Can I contribute in it? Will a PR be counted in the Hacktoberfest?
