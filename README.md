# What is surf-exel?

surf-exel is a silly editor that takes in an os path to a file, for example:
/Users/username/Dropbox/blueberry/hi.txt

and commits and overwrites the file with the input you give,in real time.

So how do we stop it asking us?
if you have ever used line-editor or ed, you have to write a full stop, .
