# The peer to peer sharing system over your wifi network 


## How does it work ?

There are two people in this , The Sender and the reciver 

The reciver is given a code (local Ip address + : + Port ) and a randomly generated password  that the RECIVER SHOULD  SHARE THE CODE AND PASSWORD WITH THE SENDER 

ONCE CONNECTED IT SENDS THE FILE.
